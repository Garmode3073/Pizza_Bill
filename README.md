# PIZZA BILLING DESKTOP APPLICATION

___



Our project is a simple user friendly desktop application to calculate bill in a Pizza shop. Once started it is quite easy to interact with, keeping all data safe.

## SOLUTION DESIGN

___

We used tkinter toolkit for GUI. We also used "Time" module of python. For the storage of data we used SQL and 'pymysql' module of python. All the widgets used are simplified for the ease of interaction between application and user.

**1. Home Screen**

This will be the first page where user will be asked for few details and order of food.

**2. THE BILL**

Once the user clicks on Total Bill the calculated value is shown in the respective Display Box. When the user clicks on 'Order' button, a bill is generated.

## IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

___

We have used python language, tkinter library mostly for the GUI of application. We have also used "Time" module of python for fetching time every second the application is running. We have used 'pymysql' module of python for storing data of every customer. We also took care of every exception while entering mobile number of name of customer.
